## Meteor framework
Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern web applications.

With Meteor you write apps:

- in modern JavaScript
- that send data over the wire, rather than HTML
- using your choice of popular open-source libraries

## Quick Start
1. Install Meteor
2. Install all NPM dependencies
3. Run application

On Linux/macOS, use this line:

`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

To install all NPM dependencies:

`meteor npm install`

To run application in development:

`meteor npm run start`

To run application in production:

`meteor npm run prod`

## Apollo GraphQL Client
Apollo Client also has view layer integrations for [all the popular frontend frameworks](#learn-how-to-use-apollo-client-with-your-favorite-framework). For the best experience, make sure to use the view integration layer for your frontend framework of choice.

Apollo Client can be used in any JavaScript frontend where you want to use data from a GraphQL server. It's:

1. **Incrementally adoptable**, so that you can drop it into an existing JavaScript app and start using GraphQL for just part of your UI.
2. **Universally compatible**, so that Apollo works with any build setup, any GraphQL server, and any GraphQL schema.
3. **Simple to get started with**, so you can start loading data right away and learn about advanced features later.
4. **Inspectable and understandable**, so that you can have great developer tools to understand exactly what is happening in your app.
5. **Built for interactive apps**, so your users can make changes and see them reflected in the UI immediately.
6. **Small and flexible**, so you don't get stuff you don't need. The core is under 25kb compressed.
7. **Community driven**, because Apollo is driven by the community and serves a variety of use cases. Everything is planned and developed in the open.
